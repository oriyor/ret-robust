# âš” NLI filtering
Our NLI filtering uses a [**bart-large-mnli**](https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large-mnli) as a decision rule to decide when to use retrieval. 
For an example script, see [**here**](src/scripts/run_nli.py). Note that the input files are in this example are csvs in the format generated by the [**reasoning-on-cots project**](https://github.com/oriyor/reasoning-on-cots/tree/master/src/experiments/retrobust).

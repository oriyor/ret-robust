Context1: James Cameron: Cameron's ""Titanic"" and ""Avatar"" are the two highest-grossing films of all time at $2.19 billion and $2.78 billion respectively. Cameron also holds the distinction of having directed the first two of the four films in history to gross over $2 billion worldwide (the later two being """" and """"). In March 2011, he was named Hollywood's top earner by ""Vanity Fair"", with estimated 2010 earnings of $257 million. In October 2013, a new species of frog ""Pristimantis jamescameroni"" from Venezuela was named after him in recognition of his efforts in environmental awareness, in addition to his public promotion of veganism.
Context2: Epic film: cited as helping to revive the genre, grossed $658 million domestically and over $2.1 billion worldwide, making it the second highest-grossing film of all-time behind the 2009 film ""Avatar"", another epic which grossed $2.7 billion worldwide. If inflation is taken into account, then the historical epic ""Gone with the Wind"" becomes the highest-grossing film ever in the United States. Adjusted for inflation it earned the equivalent of $1.6 billion in the United States alone. Adjusted for ticket price inflation, the science fiction/fantasy epic ""Star Wars"" stands at number 2, with an inflated gross of $1.4 billion in the United States.
Context3: Avatar (2009 film): Avatar (2009 film) Avatar, marketed as James Cameron's Avatar, is a 2009 American epic science fiction film directed, written, produced, and co-edited by James Cameron, and stars Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang, Michelle Rodriguez, and Sigourney Weaver. The film is set in the mid-22nd century, when humans are colonizing Pandora, a lush habitable moon of a gas giant in the Alpha Centauri star system, in order to mine the mineral unobtanium, a room-temperature superconductor.

Context1: Annabel Lee: that Edgar Allan Poe had heard of this legend, but locals insist it was his inspiration, especially considering Poe was briefly stationed in Charleston while in the army in 1827. ""Annabel Lee"" was probably composed in May 1849. Poe took steps to ensure that the poem would be seen in print.
